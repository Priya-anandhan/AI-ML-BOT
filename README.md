# Fine-tuning the Gemma 2B Model for AI/ML Q&A  

## Overview  
This project involves fine-tuning the Gemma 2B model to create a domain-specific question-answering system for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). By leveraging pre-trained weights and a curated dataset, the model is optimized for answering AI/ML-related questions with high accuracy and relevance.  

## Features  
- Fine-tunes the Gemma 2B pre-trained model using domain-specific datasets.  
- Specializes in answering questions related to AI and ML, ensuring domain expertise.  
- Includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.  
- Provides a scalable framework for further customization and deployment.  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following before running the notebook:  

### Hardware  
- A machine with a GPU (NVIDIA CUDA-supported recommended) for efficient fine-tuning.  

### Python Environment  
- Python 3.8 or later  
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab  

### Python Libraries  
- `transformers`  
- `datasets`  
- `torch`  
- `numpy`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- Additional libraries as specified in the notebook.  

## Dataset  
The fine-tuning process uses a curated dataset specific to AI/ML questions. The dataset should be structured as follows:  
- **Input:** Question text  
- **Output:** Answer text  

You can replace the dataset with your own to experiment with other domains.  

## How to Use the Notebook  

### Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone <repository-link>  
cd <repository-folder>  
```  

### Install Dependencies  
Run the following command to install the required libraries:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### Run the Notebook  
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook finetuning_of_gemma(aiml_q&a).ipynb  
   ```  
2. Execute the cells sequentially.  

### Modify Hyperparameters (Optional)  
Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, or epochs within the notebook to optimize the model's performance.  

### Save the Model  
After training, save the fine-tuned model for deployment or further experimentation.  

## Output  
The fine-tuning process produces:  
- A fine-tuned Gemma 2B model specialized in AI/ML Q&A.  
- Evaluation metrics for performance analysis.  
- Inference examples demonstrating the model's capabilities.
