# Finetuning the Gemma 2B Model for AI/ML Question-Answering  

## Overview  
This project focuses on fine-tuning the Gemma 2B model to develop a domain-specific question-answering system for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) topics. By leveraging the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique and a curated dataset, the project delivers a high-performance model tailored for AI/ML-related queries.
